When a value uses a decimal, it is called a float or floating-point number. Two numbers that are mathematically equivalent could be in two different data types. For example, mathematically 5 is equal to 5.0, yet the former is an integer while the latter is a float.\n","\n","Python can also help us manipulate text. A snippet of text in Python is called a string. A string can be written with single or double quotes, but they need to match each other and they need to be the \"straight\" version (like these), not “curly/smart” quotes (like these).\n","\n","Single quotes and double quotes do the same thing; many people use single quotes except in cases where a single quote (which is also an apostrophe) appears in the string.\n","\n","A string can use letters, spaces, line breaks, and numbers.

For example, we can ask Python whether an integer is equal to a float, but we cannot ask whether a string is equal to an integer or a float.\n","\n","To evaluate whether two values are equal, we can use two equals signs between them.

Now, let's talk about importing others' functions and writing them ourselves.\n","\n","While Python comes with many functions, there are thousands more that others have written. Adding them all to Python would create mass confusion, since many people could use the same name for functions that do different things. The solution then is that functions are stored in [modules](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#module) that can be **imported** for use. A module is a Python file (extension \".py\") that contains the definitions for the functions written in Python. These modules can then be collected into even larger groups called [packages](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#package) and [libraries](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#library). Depending on how many functions you need for the program you are writing, you may import a single module, a package of modules, or a whole library.\n","\n","The general form of importing a module is:\n","`import module_name`\n","\n","To access one of the functions in the module, you have to specify the name of the module and the name of the function, separated by a dot (also known as a period). This format is called **dot notation**.\n","\n","\n","In this section we will use several imported functions. One of those is called the [`pandas`](https://constellate-org.ezproxy.neu.edu/docs/key-terms/#pandas/) library. The `pandas` library includes functions that let you visualize and analyze data in Python.
