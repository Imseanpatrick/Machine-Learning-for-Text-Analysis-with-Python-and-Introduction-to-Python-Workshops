Machine Learning for Text Analysis with Python and Introduction to Python Workshops
This repository contains several Jupyter notebooks, a PowerPoint, and some sample data that I have used to teach my Introduction to Machine Learning for Text Analysis with Python and Introduction to Python workshops. The materials are structured such that novice learners can progress from the slide set to understand key concepts, then proceed to the Introduction to Python module to understand basic Python, and finally move on to the Machine Learning for Text Analysis with Python notebook.

The materials are designed to be run in Google Colab to simplify package management and installation issues for novice learners. Google Colab also provides an easy way to share data with participants, making it more accessible. The notebooks can be customized for users to apply with their own datasets and can be viewed as both an instructional tool and a template.

One participant successfully used these materials for a project in an industry settingâ€”hooray!

You can try these notebooks directly on Google Colab by clicking the links below:
