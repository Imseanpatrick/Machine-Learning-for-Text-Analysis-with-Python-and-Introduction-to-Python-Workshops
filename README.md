# Machine Learning for Text Analysis with Python and Introduction to Python Workshops

This repository contains several Jupyter notebooks, a PowerPoint, and some sample data that I have used to teach my **Introduction to Machine Learning for Text Analysis with Python**, and **Introduction to Python** workshops. The materials are structured such that novice learners can go from the slide set to understand key concepts, then proceed to the Introduction to Python module to understand basic Python, and finally progress to the Introduction to Machine Learning for Text Analysis with Python notebook.

The materials are designed to be run in Google Colab as this simplifies package management and installation issues for novice learners and provides an easy way of getting data to learners with little effort on their part. The notebooks are designed so that they can be customized for users to use with their own datasets, and can be thought of as part instructional tool and part template. I have received feedback that at least one individual successfully used the materials to complete their own project in an industry setting--Hooray!

The code should work if you upload the `.ipynb` files to Google Drive and open in Colab, or click the links below to make a copy of the versions I share during the workshop.
