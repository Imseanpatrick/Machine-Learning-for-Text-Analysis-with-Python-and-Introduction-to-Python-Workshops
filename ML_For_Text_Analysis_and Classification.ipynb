Adding them all to Python would create mass confusion, since many people could use the same name for functions that do different things. The solution then is that functions are stored in [modules](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#module) that can be **imported** for use. A module is a Python file (extension \".py\") that contains the definitions for the functions written in Python. These modules can then be collected into even larger groups called [packages](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#package) and [libraries](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#library). Depending on how many functions you need for the program you are writing, you may import a single module, a package of modules, or a whole library.\n","\n","The general form of importing a module is:\n","`import module_name`"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZkUHsfKd8fU0"},"source":["We start here by doing the following:\n","- Using pip to install packages\n","- Downloading tools from [NLTK](https://constellate-org.ezproxy.neu.edu/docs/key-terms/#nltk)\n","- Importing other general python packages\n","- Importing tools from SKlearn\n","- Importing tools from google files\n","\n","It is best practice to put all imports and downloads in the first cell of a notebook so that all packages necessary to complete the task are downloaded."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":28854,"status":"ok","timestamp":1722341155178,"user":{"displayName":"Sean Rogers","userId":"11020619090608962673"},"user_tz":240},"id":"W-eYjF86shLw","outputId":"fac81c32-7df2-4169-9653-ea861f4a560e"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Collecting contractions\n","  Downloading contractions-0.1.73-py2.py3-none-any.whl.metadata (1.2 kB)\n","Collecting textsearch>=0.0.21 (from contractions)\n","  Downloading textsearch-0.0.24-py2.py3-none-any.whl.metadata (1.2 kB)\n","Collecting anyascii (from textsearch>=0.0.21->contractions)\n","  Downloading anyascii-0.3.2-py3-none-any.whl.metadata (1.5 kB)\n","Collecting pyahocorasick (from textsearch>=0.0.21->contractions)\n","  Downloading pyahocorasick-2.1.0-cp310-cp310-manylinux_2_5_x86_64.manylinux1_x86_64.manylinux_2_12_x86_64.manylinux2010_x86_64.whl.metadata (13 kB)\n","Downloading contractions-0.1.73-py2.py3-none-any.whl (8.7 kB)\n","Downloading textsearch-0.0.24-py2.py3-none-any.whl (7.6 kB)\n","Downloading anyascii-0.3.2-py3-none-any.whl (289 kB)\n","\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m289.9/289.9 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m15.6 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25hDownloading pyahocorasick-2.1.0-cp310-cp310-manylinux_2_5_x86_64.manylinux1_x86_64.manylinux_2_12_x86_64.manylinux2010_x86_64.whl (110 kB)\n","\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m110.7/110.7 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m3.4 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25hInstalling collected packages: pyahocorasick, anyascii, textsearch, contractions\n","Successfully installed anyascii-0.3.2 contractions-0.1.73 pyahocorasick-2.1.0 textsearch-0.0.24\n","Collecting demoji\n","  Downloading demoji-1.1.0-py3-none-any.whl.metadata (9.2 kB)\n","Downloading demoji-1.1.0-py3-none-any.whl (42 kB)\n","\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m42.9/42.9 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m2.2 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25hInstalling collected packages: demoji\n","Successfully installed demoji-1.1.0\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Unzipping corpora/stopwords.zip.\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package punkt to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Unzipping tokenizers/punkt.zip.\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package wordnet to /root/nltk_data...\n"]}],"source":["#Installing Packages\n","!pip install contractions\n","!pip install demoji\n","\n","#downloading NLTK tools\n","import nltk\n","nltk.download('stopwords')\n","nltk.download('punkt')\n","nltk.download('wordnet')\n","\n","from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n","from nltk import word_tokenize\n","from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\n","\n","#Importing other python packages\n","import re\n","import contractions\n","import string\n","import demoji\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import sklearn as sk\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","\n","#Importing SKlearn modules\n","from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n","from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix\n","from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfTransformer\n","from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n","from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n","from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n","from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC\n","from sklearn.metrics import classification_report\n","from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer, f1_score\n","from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n","\n","#Googly stuff\n","from google.colab import files\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9c2Apmi7P6j-"},"source":["To access one of the functions in the module, you have to specify the name of the module and the name of the function, separated by a dot (also known as a period).

We need to initialize several variables to use the ``pipeline`` tool to construct our model. First, we initialize a variable called ``my_targets`` that is a list of our target classes, which in this case are all the unique values in our ``harm_category`` column. We then initialize the ``model`` variable. In this instance, we are using a ``RandomForestClassifier``, but we can change the model name to test different algorithms. Generally speaking, we should  try at least three different algorithms and compare the performance (we will discuss how to do this in a bit). We then initialize the variable ``vectorizer_1`` as a ``TfidfVectorizer()``.\n","\n","Now that we have the variables initialized, we can use the ``ColumnTransformer()`` to tell the pipeline how we want data to be processed. We need to give a name for the vectorizer, so here we call our vectorizer ``tfidf1`` and give it our ``vectorizer1`` variable. We then pass the function our ``joined_tokens`` column containing the preprocessed text. This tells the pipeline to take our ``joined_tokens`` column and pass it through the ``tfidf1`` vectorizer. We set the ``remainder`` paramater to ``passthrough`` to tell the model to send our one hot ecoded features through the vectorizer unchanged. We do this because a vectorizer transforms textual data to weighted numerical data and text key value pairs, and the one hot encoded feaatures are already numerical.\n","\n","Now that we have our variables iitialized and our column transformer set, we can construct our classification pipeline using the ``Pipeline()`` function from SkLearn. First, we initialize the ``pipe`` variable as the ``Pipeline()`` function. This fuction takes key value pairs as parameters that dictate how the classification pipeline flows. We insert our ``column_transformer`` as ``tfidf`` because it transforms the ``joined_tokens`` to weighted key-value pairs using the ``TfidfVectorizer()``.\n","\n","Next, we insert our ``model`` variable as the ``classify`` step in the pipeline because our chosen algorithm will be used to train the model. Finally, we call the ``fit()`` function on our ``pipe`` variable, and pass it our ``X_train`` and ``y_train`` variables we created earlier when we split our data. Fitting our model with these traget and feature vectors trains it on the examples given in the training data to teach the model how to map the inputs to the expected outputs. Colab even presents with a tidy visualization of how our classification model flows. Congratulations, you have now trained (maybe your first) machine learing model!

it in the training proccess. First, we need our model to make predictions on the unseen data. To do this, we initialize the ``y_pred`` variable. To make the predictions, we call the ``predict()`` function on our model, ``pipe``, and pass it our test dataset ``X_test``. This uses the model we trained to evaluate the data it has not seen yet so we can see how well it generalizes. To assess this quantitatively, we use the ``accuracy_score()`` and ``classification_report()`` functions.\n","\n","First, call the ``accuracy_score()`` function, and pass it our ``y_pred`` variable (the predictions) and our ``y_test`` variable (the actual categories). We wrap this in a ``print()`` function so we can print the accuracy scores. Next, we call the ``classification_report()`` function and pass it our ``y_test``, ``y_pred``, and ``target_names`` variables, and again wrap it in a ``print()`` function so we can see the results. Doing this allows us to see a classification report that gives us ``accuracy``, ``precision``, ``recall``, and ``F1`` scores for the different ``target classes`` in our data.\n","\n","To further evaluate our model, we perform use ``cross-validation`` with 5 ``folds`` to evaluate the model's ``F1 score``. We calculate the average ``F1 score`` across classes for each fold to get a sense of the model's overall performance.\n","\n","In addition to cross-validation, we examine the predictions our model made on our ``test set``. The ''confusion matrix'' shows the counts of ``true positives``, ``false positives``, ``true negatives``, and ``false negatives``, providing a detailed view of the model’s performance.\n","\n","After ``cross-validation``, we make predictions on the unseen test dataset. We then calculate the accuracy score to assess the proportion of correctly classified instances. Lastly, we generate a classification report that includes the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores for each target class, giving a comprehensive evaluation of the model’s performance.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":27,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":579,"status":"ok","timestamp":1722341173830,"user":{"displayName":"Sean
